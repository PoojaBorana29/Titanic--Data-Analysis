# 🛳️ Titanic Dataset – Exploring the dataset using visualization

This project is part of my Machine Learning learning journey. I performed detailed descriptive statistics and visual exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset to understand data structure, missing values, and relationships between features such as Passenger Class, Gender, Age, and Survival.

## 📌 Project Overview:
In this project, I explored the Titanic dataset to answer questions like:

 - What features influence survival?
 - Does passenger class impact survival?
 - Does gender matter?
 - How does age distribution look?
 - How many values are missing and how to handle them?

The main goal was to build a strong EDA foundation before moving into ML models.

## 📊 Work Done:

1️⃣ Setup
  - Imported necessary libraries(pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn) and loaded dataset.

2️⃣ Basic Data Checks:
  - Checked overall structure with info().
  - Identified columns categoaries (numerical and categorical).
  - Unique value counts for columns(Survived, Pclass, Sex, Embarked) to get basic idea of dataset.
  - Examined duplicated and missing values.

3️⃣ Descriptive Statistics

  - Generated summary statistics using describe().
  - Observed distributions of numeric fields (Age, Fare).
  - Examined basic patterns in passenger groups (Survived vs Non-survived).

4️⃣ Feature Exploration

  - Explored distributions (Gender, Pclass, Embarked) to get insights of survival distribution.

## ✅ Conclusion:

This project was to undersatnd the basics of **exploratory analysis**. How **data cleaning, visualization, and feature exploration** are foundation blocks for building any **machine learning models**.
